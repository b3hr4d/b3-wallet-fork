          Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. If you send
          cryptocurrency to the wrong address, or if your wallet is compromised
          due to security vulnerabilities, you may lose your funds permanently.
          Always double-check addresses and transaction details before sending
          cryptocurrency.
